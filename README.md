# Sterre's dotfiles

Worked with nano to edit the dotfiles: `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`. 

**I added**: 
01. Aliases:
- `alias c='clear'`
- `alias lsa='ls -a'`
- `alias n='nano'`
- `alias p='pwd'`
- `alias ~='cd ~'`
This is just a start, when working more with bash, I sure will need more aliases. 

02. A welcome Message, showing the weather in my hometown. 

03. Changed my prompt name into: `PS1='Sterre--> '` 

04. Also tried to download rupa/z. I'm not sure if it works because it didn't respond. Maybe because it has to build up a data base?
